you are free to use parts of the Quran code in your application

* your app must be respectful of the book of Allah.  adding advertisements
above and below each page of Quran is unacceptable.

why not just contribute a patch instead?

translations, etc), you must provide a link to the respective data source
page ([tanzil.net](http://tanzil.net) for the translations and the
